We propose an acoustic AR type virtual TA agent (AVTA) corresponding to participating attitudes of audiences in a lecture.

In one-to-many communications such as lectures with over 100 audiences, there are some audiences who do not concentrate on the lecture.
In such case, it is difficult to make such audiences to pay attention toward the lecture
during ongoing lecture at the same time.

To improve the attitude of the audience who does not concentrate on the lecture, we propose the AVTA; localized sound of footsteps using a direction-controllable parametric speaker.
Based on the hypothesis that the footsteps toward the audience indirectly notice her/his problematic attitude, we conduced two experiments for verification.

As the results, the participants felt as though someone exists and walks around there 
by perceiving the movement of sound localization of footsteps, and as though the subject of footsteps is lecturer or TA.
